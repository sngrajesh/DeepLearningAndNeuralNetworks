# McCulloch-Pitts Neural Network

## Overview
The McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neural network, proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943, is a groundbreaking computational model that laid the theoretical foundation for artificial neural networks. This pioneering model represents one of the first attempts to mathematically model the functioning of biological neurons using a simplified computational approach.

## Key Characteristics

### Structure
- **Simplified Neuron Model**: Represents a single artificial neuron as a binary threshold unit
- **Inputs**: Receives multiple binary inputs (0 or 1)
- **Weights**: Each input has an associated weight
- **Activation**: Produces a binary output based on a threshold mechanism

### Mathematical Model
1. **Input Processing**:
   - Inputs are multiplied by their respective weights
   - Sum of weighted inputs is calculated
   - The sum is compared against a predefined threshold

2. **Activation Function**:
   - If the weighted sum exceeds the threshold: Output = 1
   - If the weighted sum is less than the threshold: Output = 0
